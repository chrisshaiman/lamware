## Review findings (2026-03-30)

Issues identified during second architecture/security review. Address criticals and highs
before Ansible role implementation.

### Critical — blocks terraform apply

- [x] **SQS module: missing `resource` declaration for `aws_secretsmanager_secret.baremetal_credentials`.**
      Line 246 of `aws/modules/sqs/main.tf` has the block body (name, description, kms_key_id, tags)
      but the `resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "baremetal_credentials" {` opener is missing.
      `terraform plan` will fail with a parse error.
      *Files:* `aws/modules/sqs/main.tf`

### Security — high priority

- [x] **VPC Flow Log IAM role uses `Resource = "*"`.**
      The `aws_iam_role_policy.flow_log` policy allows `logs:CreateLogGroup/Stream/PutLogEvents`
      on all CloudWatch log groups. Should be scoped to the specific flow log group ARN.
      *Files:* `aws/modules/vpc/main.tf`

- [x] **Packer: `shutdown_command` echoes `ssh_password` into build logs.**
      `echo '${var.ssh_password}' | sudo -S shutdown -P now` — the packer user already has
      `NOPASSWD:ALL` from user-data sudoers, so the password flag is unnecessary.
      Fix: `sudo shutdown -P now`.
      *Files:* `packer/ubuntu-sandbox.pkr.hcl`

- [x] **Packer: `pip3 install || true` silently swallows dependency failures.**
      A broken CAPEv2 requirements install produces a healthy-looking image that fails at runtime.
      Remove `|| true` so the build fails fast on dependency errors.
      *Files:* `packer/ubuntu-sandbox.pkr.hcl`

### Operational — medium priority

- [x] **Lambda CloudWatch log retention inconsistent with rest of stack.**
      Lambda logs retain 30 days; VPC flow logs and API Gateway logs retain 90 days.
      Forensic consistency argues for 90 days across all log groups.
      *Files:* `aws/modules/lambda/main.tf`

- [x] **SQS visibility timeout has no buffer for post-analysis S3 upload.**
      Fixed 2026-03-30. Raised default from 3600s to 5400s (90 min): 60 min worst-case
      analysis + 30 min buffer for report upload. Prevents duplicate detonations on
      slow or complex samples.
      *Files:* `aws/modules/sqs/variables.tf`

- [x] **`budget_alert_emails` variable has no non-empty validation.**
      Fixed 2026-03-30. Added validation block — `terraform plan` now fails with a clear
      error message if the list is empty rather than silently creating a budget that notifies nobody.
      *Files:* `aws/envs/prod/variables.tf`

- [ ] **`report_processor.py` uses `os.environ["AWS_REGION_NAME"]` without fallback.**
      `sample_submitter.py` uses `.get(..., "us-east-1")` — `report_processor.py` should match.
      **Deferred** — fix when implementing the real handler (post-Cape). File is a stub; no value in patching it now.
      *Files:* `src/report_processor.py`

### Documentation — medium priority

- [x] **CLAUDE.md "Build next" section lists completed work as pending.**
      Fixed 2026-03-30. Replaced stale 9-item list with a pointer to STATUS.md and
      the actual remaining work (Ansible roles + report_processor stub).
      *Files:* `CLAUDE.md`

- [x] **COST_ESTIMATE.md summary arithmetic is wrong.**
      Fixed 2026-03-30. Table was correct ($108/$148); narrative text had stale figures.
      Corrected narrative to match: ADVANCE-1 ~$148, RISE-1 ~$108.
      *Files:* `docs/COST_ESTIMATE.md`

- [x] **STATUS.md "Next session recommendation" section is redundant.**
      Fixed 2026-03-30. Removed — all items were already resolved and tracked in the findings sections.
      *Files:* `docs/STATUS.md`

- [x] **ARCHITECTURE.md implies Ansible roles are implemented.**
      Fixed 2026-03-30. Added status note above the roles table pointing to STATUS.md.
      *Files:* `ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Review findings (2026-03-29)

Issues identified during architecture/security review. Investigate and address
in the next round of implementation work.

### Security — high priority

- [x] **Bare metal IAM: long-lived access keys on a host that runs malware.**
      Fixed 2026-03-29. IAM user scoped to `sts:AssumeRole` only. Real SQS/S3/KMS
      permissions moved to `aws_iam_role.baremetal_agent` (1-hour sessions).
      Role ARN added to Secrets Manager secret. Queue policy updated to role ARN.
      CloudTrail remains the detection surface for anomalous AssumeRole calls.
      *Files:* `aws/modules/sqs/main.tf`, `aws/modules/sqs/outputs.tf`

- [x] **Lambda SG egress hardcodes VPC CIDR (`10.20.0.0/16`).**
      Fixed 2026-03-29. Removed inline egress blocks from Lambda SG. Added
      `aws_vpc_security_group_egress_rule` resources in `prod/main.tf`:
      port 5432 → RDS SG via `referenced_security_group_id`; port 443 → `var.vpc_cidr`.
      All cross-module SG wiring is now in the composition layer.
      *Files:* `aws/modules/lambda/main.tf`, `aws/envs/prod/main.tf`

- [x] **RDS security group allows unrestricted egress (`0.0.0.0/0`).**
      Fixed 2026-03-29. Explicit `egress = []` — Terraform will remove the
      default allow-all rule. SGs are stateful; response traffic needs no rule.
      *Files:* `aws/modules/rds/main.tf`

- [~] **S3 Object Lock uses GOVERNANCE mode, not COMPLIANCE.**
      Intentional decision — see ADR-007. GOVERNANCE is correct for current use case;
      COMPLIANCE would prevent purging samples under a legal takedown or policy change.
      Known limitation: does not meet evidentiary chain-of-custody standards.
      Upgrade path documented in ADR-007 and in-code comment. One-line change when needed.
      *Files:* `aws/modules/s3/main.tf`, `docs/DECISIONS.md` (ADR-007)

- [x] **No Secrets Manager rotation configured.**
      Fixed 2026-03-29. RDS password rotates every 30 days via AWS SAR rotation Lambda
      (`SecretsManagerRDSPostgreSQLRotationSingleUser`). Lambda runs in the VPC with
      its own SG (egress to RDS 5432 + Secrets Manager endpoint 443). Rotation Lambda
      ingress rule added to RDS SG in composition layer.
      Cape API key and WireGuard keys are not rotated — both are set manually and have
      no AWS-native rotation path. Operator rotates manually as needed.
      *Files:* `aws/envs/prod/main.tf`

### Operational — high priority

- [x] **No DLQ alarm.**
      Fixed 2026-03-29. `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm.dlq_depth` added to SQS module.
      Fires when any message lands in the DLQ. Optional `alarm_sns_topic_arns` variable
      wires it to an SNS topic — alarm exists and changes state regardless.
      *Files:* `aws/modules/sqs/main.tf`, `aws/modules/sqs/variables.tf`, `aws/modules/sqs/outputs.tf`

- [ ] **No VPC Flow Log alerting.** Logs go to CloudWatch but nothing watches
      them. **Deferred → future scope.** With tight SG rules in place, the VPC
      attack surface is narrow and flow log alerting has low signal-to-noise for
      this architecture. The detonation network (where malware runs) is on OVH —
      not visible to AWS VPC flow logs at all. CloudTrail (AssumeRole calls, S3
      access) is higher-value monitoring for this threat model. Logs retained for
      forensic use.

- [ ] **Reports bucket has no object lock or expiration.** Samples bucket has
      object lock (good), but reports accumulate indefinitely with no tamper
      protection and no lifecycle expiration.
      **Deferred → future scope.** Reports are re-generatable by re-running the
      sample — object lock has low value here. Existing lifecycle rule already
      moves reports to Glacier after 90 days, so accumulation cost is minimal.
      Expiration rule (e.g. 2 years) is a cost hygiene item, not a security issue.

- [x] **SQS visibility timeout (30 min) may be too short.**
      Fixed 2026-03-29. Default raised to 60 min in `variables.tf`.
      *Files:* `aws/modules/sqs/variables.tf`

### Architecture — medium priority

- [ ] **RDS ingress rule wired in composition layer, not the module.**
      If someone writes a new environment and forgets the rule, Lambda silently
      can't reach the DB. Consider accepting `allowed_security_group_ids` as a
      variable in the RDS module.
      *Files:* `aws/modules/rds/main.tf`, `aws/envs/prod/main.tf`

- [x] **Lambda deployment packages don't exist.**
      Fixed 2026-03-29. `src/report_processor.py` and `src/sample_submitter.py`
      created as functional stubs. `make lambda` builds the zips. tfvars.example
      updated with correct paths. `terraform apply` will now succeed.
      *Files:* `src/`, `Makefile`, `aws/envs/prod/terraform.tfvars.example`

- [x] **`shared/backend-aws.hcl` has placeholder bucket name.**
      Fixed 2026-03-29. Added `make configure-backend` — reads bootstrap outputs and
      writes the file with real values. First-time setup order documented in `make help`.
      *Files:* `Makefile`

### Operational — medium priority

- [x] **No budget alerts.**
      Fixed 2026-03-29. `aws_budgets_budget.monthly` alerts at 80% actual and 100%
      forecasted against a configurable limit (default $75/month). Email addresses set
      via `budget_alert_emails` in terraform.tfvars.
      *Files:* `aws/envs/prod/main.tf`, `aws/envs/prod/variables.tf`, `aws/envs/prod/terraform.tfvars.example`

- [ ] **No CloudWatch dashboard.** No unified view of Lambda errors, SQS queue
      depth, RDS connections, or S3 request rates.
      **Deferred → low priority / future scope**

- [ ] **No backup/restore documentation for RDS.** 7-day retention + final
      snapshot configured, but no documented restore procedure.
      **Deferred → low priority / future scope**

---

## Lambda handlers — implementation status

- [x] **`src/sample_submitter.py` — implemented 2026-03-29.**
      Validates `{filename, sha256, tags}` → sanitizes filename (path traversal strip)
      → generates pre-signed S3 PUT URL (15 min TTL) → enqueues SQS job
      → returns `{task_id, upload_url, expires_in, s3_key}`. boto3 clients
      initialised at module level for warm-start reuse. Full input validation
      and structured error responses.

- [ ] **`src/report_processor.py` — defer until Cape is running.**
      Needs real Cape JSON report output to define the parser and RDS schema correctly.
      Building it blind risks getting the schema wrong and rewriting it anyway.
      **Do after:** OVH provisioned → Ansible configured → Cape running → sample detonated
      → actual report JSON captured. Then implement parser + define RDS tables together.

---

## Future scope (not started, not prioritised)

- RDS ingress rule: move from composition layer into RDS module (accept `allowed_security_group_ids` variable)
- CloudWatch dashboard: Lambda errors, SQS depth, RDS connections, S3 request rates
- RDS backup/restore runbook
- VPC Flow Log alerting — low value given tight SGs; CloudTrail is higher signal for this threat model
- Reports bucket expiration rule (~2 years) — cost hygiene; object lock not warranted (reports are re-generatable)
- Static analysis agent (Ghidra headless / Binary Ninja API)
- Memory forensics agent (Volatility 3 post-detonation)
- Agent orchestration layer (Step Functions or separate service)
- Windows guest Packer image (Cape detonation VM)
- Alternative bare metal provider module (Vultr/Latitude.sh) if OVH proves unworkable
